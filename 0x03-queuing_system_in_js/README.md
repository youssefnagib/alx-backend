## Introduction
Queuing systems are crucial for handling tasks asynchronously in distributed applications. This project showcases how to implement and manage queues, allowing background processing and task prioritization.

## Features
- **Task Queuing:** Add tasks to a queue and process them asynchronously.
- **Job Prioritization:** Assign priorities to jobs.
- **Failure Handling:** Retry failed tasks automatically.
- **Redis Integration:** Use Redis as a backend for job storage and processing.

## Technologies
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used as a message broker.
- **Kue**: A priority job queue backed by Redis.
